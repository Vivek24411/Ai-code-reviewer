❌ Bad Code:\n```javascript\nfunction(){return(a+b)}\n```\n\n🔍 Issues:\n*   ❌ Missing function name. Anonymous functions should be assigned to a variable or immediately invoked.\n*   ❌ Implicitly relies on `a` and `b` being defined in the scope where this function is used. This can lead to unexpected behavior if `a` and `b` are not defined or have unexpected values.\n*   ❌ Lacks clear purpose or context without a function name or description.\n\n✅ Recommended Fix:\n\n```javascript\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n💡 Improvements:\n\n*   ✔️ Clear and descriptive function name (`add`).\n*   ✔️ Explicitly declares `a` and `b` as parameters, making the function's dependencies clear.\n*   ✔️ Removes unnecessary parentheses around the `return` value for better readability.\n\nFinal Note:\nAlways strive for clarity and explicitness in your code. Naming functions and explicitly declaring parameters make your code easier to understand and maintain. Consider adding a comment to further explain the function's purpose if it's not immediately obvious from the name and parameters. For example:\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Adds two numbers together.\n * @param {number} a The first number.\n * @param {number} b The second number.\n * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n"
